# Music Genre Classification

## Re-onboarding process:
  - Read audio data preprocessing process (write a blog)
  - Re-implement in Pytorch
      - data pipeline
      - model building
      - finetuning pretrained models
      - model checkpointing
      - model saving
      - model deployment


## Reinitialization process:
  - Document the old experiments and significant insights
  - Make inferencing time faster
  - Deploy the api with current best model
  - Explore experiments and make thorough experiment documentation
  - Realtime inferencing with django channel
  - Data augmentation to simulate realtime audio
  - Tryout transformer models
  - Build custom dataset
  - Implement model training library
  - Make api endpoints better, more secure and add more features
