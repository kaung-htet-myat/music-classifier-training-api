# Music Genre Classification

## Re-onboarding process:
  - Read audio data preprocessing process (write a blog)
  - Data preprocessing in tensorflow
  - Inferencing process
  - Model saving process
  - Model inferencing from api
  - How api endpoints are written


## Reinitialization process:
  - Document the experiments and significant insights
  - Make inferencing time faster
  - Serve with tensorflow serving
  - Deploy the api with current best model
  - Realtime inferencing with django channel
  - Data augmentation to simulate realtime audio
  - Tryout transformer models
  - Build custom dataset
  - Implement model training library
  - Make api endpoints better, more secure and more features
